For more information on this structure, i. e. the `after/plugin/` path, check `:help after-directory` and keep an eye on `plugin/`. Files in `after/plugin/` are processed after the plugin manager has loaded all plugins. So, placing plugin configurations in this directory only makes sense if the plugin can be setup **after** the loading procedure of the plugin manager. This is the case, when the plugin, f. i. `telescope`, need's to be setup via a described `setup` function call. Other plugins like `wiki.vim` don't offer this mechanic (configuring after loading) and need all information/options before the plugin manager loads the plugins. Hence, some configurations (`wiki.vim`s) are in `lua/plugins/`.
